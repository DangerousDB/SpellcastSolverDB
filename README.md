# SpellcastSolver
Solves the discord game spellcaster given the board state.

By going into board.txt and changing the values in it to match your board state, the solver can get words up to 8 letters in length. This includes swaps if you add in a 1 to the end of your board, 0 if you dont care about swaps.

the "/" character before a letter means that letter is doubled in value
the "?" character before a letter means that letter is tripled in value
the "#" character before a letter means that letter is the double point character

see board.txt for an example
